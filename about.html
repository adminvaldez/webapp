    <h1 class="mb-3">About VALDEZTECH Property Solutions</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      VALDEZTECH Property Solutions is a locally owned exterior maintenance and
      power washing company serving Spring Branch and surrounding Houston
      neighborhoods.
    </p>

    <p>
      We focus on preventative care, safe cleaning practices, and responsible
      documentation—helping property owners protect their investments while
      supporting cleaner, safer communities.

<!-- PURPOSE -->
<section class="pb-5">
  <div class="container content-block">
    <h2 class="mb-3">Why We Exist</h2>
    <p>
      Small exterior issues often go unnoticed until they become costly repairs
      or safety hazards. Mold buildup, slippery surfaces, and storm-related
      damage can quietly shorten the life of a property if left unaddressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      VALDEZTECH exists to help property owners take care of these issues early
      through professional power washing, exterior maintenance, and clear
      documentation—before minor problems turn into major ones.
    </p>

<!-- COMMUNITY -->
<section class="pb-5">
  <div class="container content-block">
    <h2 class="mb-3">Community First Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Our work is grounded in community responsibility. We serve homeowners,
      landlords, and small businesses who want dependable service without
      unnecessary upselling or rushed work.
    </p>

    <p>
      By helping maintain properties consistently, we contribute to safer
      walkways, improved curb appeal, and more stable neighborhood property
      values—especially in areas where regular maintenance is often deferred.

<!-- FOUNDER -->
<section class="pb-5">
  <div class="container content-block">
    <h2 class="mb-3">Our Background</h2>
    <p>
      VALDEZTECH was founded with experience in data management, operations, and
      asset planning. This background shapes how we approach our work—from
      organized scheduling and accurate documentation to transparent service
      delivery.
    </p>

    <p>
      We apply the same discipline and attention to detail to exterior cleaning
      that larger organizations apply to asset management—ensuring work is done
      methodically, safely, and with long-term outcomes in mind.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted">
      The result is professional service that prioritizes property preservation,
      environmental awareness, and customer trust.
